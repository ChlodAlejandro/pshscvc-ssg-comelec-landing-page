            <p>
                Thank you for participating in this year's Supreme Student Government elections! We received a total of 501 votes, around 85% of the student population. The results of the election have been published on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=117124524075547&id=103853102069356">PSHS-CVC SSG's Facebook page</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Special thanks is given to all the Commission on Election Commissioners who helped make this happen, and to our Supreme Student Government adviser, Mr. Lyndon Lazaro.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll meet again for the induction and oath-taking of incoming SSG officers, to be conducted on October 25, 2021.
